This project describes the implementation of a Snake game, programmed in Python. In this game, the user is controlling the movement of a snake using arrow keys. The goal of the game is to navigate the snake to eat food that appears on the screen while avoiding the snake's death. The game becomes more challenging with every food eaten. The game ends if the snake crashes into the boundaries of the screen, or when the snake's head tries to cross its own body.
We decided to create several functions and split them between us! Obviously, if one of us have problems with a function, the other will help and vice-versa.
#	Description:
We will have several functions: 

•	Create a screen where the player could play the game. (Display Module)
•	Create pixels (Food) at regular interval which the Snake can eat and grow. (Display Module).
•	Create a line (Snake) which the player can control by “arrow keys”. (Calculate module).

•	Create a function which makes the Snake grow when it eat food. (Calculate module).

•	Create a function that stops the game when the snake’s head reach his tail. (Calculate module).

Secondary functions that could be create: 
•	Create a counter that count how many food the snake ate.

•	Create a database for this game. (Actually we can create a database for the snake game but we don’t know how to relate SQL and Python).

#	test the  project:
•	Function testing, each function will be tested one by one until everything works perfectly.

•	Module testing, each module (Display or Calculate) will be tested, it is very useful to see if the Display module works and not the Calculate one and vice-versa.

•	project testing , the whole project will be tested.

•	Distribution of tasks
We decided to split the work in three parts : 

•	Display module: Lovas Bence 

•	Calculate module: Khellas Bouchra Dilan Danial 

This is just a representation of the work because the display module will be easier ( I guess) than the calculate module, so both of us will do the Calculate module.

- Our game is a basic Snake game. To play, you will need to install python3, dowload PYGAMES packages and random functions (already included in the python3 I guess)
- You can play by pressing Z to go UP, D to RIGHT, Q to go LEFT, S to go DOWN and ESC to exit. Have fun !!
